# MySQL_Consumer_Goods
Project Title : Provide Insights to Management in Consumer Goods Domain

Problem statement : 
AtliQ Hardwares (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and has expanded well in other countries too.However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, their data analytics director, wanted to hire someone good at both tech and soft skills. Hence, he decided to conduct a SQL challenge, which will help him understand both skills.

Task :

As part of the SQL and analytics challenge, I completed the following:

1) Reviewed ad-hoc-requests.pdf, which contained 10 business questions requiring insights.
2) Imported the dataset into MySQL and wrote optimized SQL queries to extract and analyze the data to answer each request.
3) Transformed the query outputs into interactive visuals using Power BI, focusing on KPIs and actionable metrics for top-level management.
4) Created a management-ready presentation in PowerPoint, summarizing the insights with a clear narrative and recommendations.
   
Tools used : 

1) 𝐌𝐲𝐒𝐐𝐋 - to query the database
2) 𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐁𝐈 - to visualize the data
3) 𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫𝐏𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐭 - to present the Insights
